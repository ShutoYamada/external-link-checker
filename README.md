# External Link Checker

External Link Checker is a Python-based tool designed to help website administrators maintain the integrity of their external links. It scrapes a website recursively from the homepage, identifies all external links, and periodically checks their validity to ensure they are not leading to malicious or inactive sites. This project aims to prevent potential security risks and protect brand reputation by ensuring that all external links remain safe and relevant over time.

## Features
- Recursive scraping from the homepage to identify all links.
- Differentiation between internal and external links.
- Periodic validity checks for all identified external links.
- Easy-to-read reports on the status of external links.
